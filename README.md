## Tip:-
If workflow stopped working or if you want to re-run the workflow, first make sure that workflow is stopped. You can stop the workflow in "actions" tab.
Now to start the workflow, goto looper.txt and remove the last letter/digit i.e if its 12345 then remove the last letter/digit to make it 1234 and commit the file.

And That's it.

Thanks to [Â©ElytrA8](https://github.com/ElytrA8) for the base of the workflow.
